* SoC Sleep Stats

Always On Processor/Resource Power Manager maintains statistics of the SoC
sleep modes involving lowering or powering down of the backbone rails - Cx
and Mx and the oscillator clock XO.

Statistics includes SoC sleep mode type, number of times low power mode were
entered, time of last entry, time of last exit and accumulated sleep duration.
SoC Sleep Stats driver provides sysfs interface to display this information.

Properties:

- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: Should be "qcom,rpmh-sleep-stats" or "qcom,rpm-sleep-stats".

- reg:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: The base address on the Always On Processor or Resource Power
		    Manager from where the stats are read.

EXAMPLE 1:

	rpmh_sleep_stats: soc-sleep-stats@c3f0000 {
		compatible = "qcom,rpmh-sleep-stats";
		reg = <0 0xc3f0000 0 0x400>;
	};

EXAMPLE 2:

	rpm_sleep_stats: soc-sleep-stats@4690000 {
		compatible = "qcom,rpm-sleep-stats";
		reg = <0 0x04690000 0 0x400>;
	};
